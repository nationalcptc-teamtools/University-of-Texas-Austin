    "description": "There is an active guest account that can be used to log in to most Windows authentication applications and machines. This account does not have a password and is thus easily accessible to attackers. The Guest account is disabled by default and is not intended to be enabled without specifically restricted privileges for a limited period of time.",
    "impact":"Attackers can use default guest credentials to access many company resources such as workstations and email services. Additionally, attackers can read active directory information that does not require privileged access.",
    "confirmation":"Connect to Windows machines via services like RDP by providing 'guest' as the username and supplying a blank password. It may be required to provide a domain within the username (e.g. `corp.kkms.local{\\textbackslash}guest').",
    "remediation":"Disable the guest account. If the guest account is needed, temporarily enable it with reduced permissions and immediately disable the account when finished.",
